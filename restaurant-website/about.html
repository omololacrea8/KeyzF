          <p>Keyz Foodora is an ambitious, world-class modern African brand.
            We started operations in 2020 and have already opened over 2 stores within Nigeria,
            making us proud of our hard-earned reputation as the fastest growing food restaurant brand in West Africa.
            Our simple “Taste More” philosophy encourages a bold spirit of adventure as we set out to challenge the status quo by constantly raising the quality and standards of our products and services. 
            As a member of the Food Concepts Group we are also pleased to announce, that as of 3rd of March 2020, 
            we became ISO certified by successfully undertaking the quality management systems audit (NIS ISO 9001: 2000). 
            Our primary aim was to improve on our preexisting operational excellence policy and to ensure that the restaurant internal processes are aligned with internationally accepted standards.
            We invite our customers to experience more as they interact with our brand and enjoy the sensory pleasures of our sizzling hot meals and sides. All flavoured to perfection with our 
            unique blend of authentic West African herbs and spices.
            We encourage our staff and franchisees to passionately learn, grow and strive for more, both to their own benefit and to the ultimate benefit of our customers.
            On this basis, Keyz Foodora prides itself on the consistent delivery of product excellence, great value and impeccable customer service. All brought to life by warmly engaging with our customers in energetic, progressive, quick service restaurant environments.</p>
